/**
 * The external-merge watcher. When the merge stage is off (mergeEnabled=false)
 * a run pushes the change request, marks it ready for review, and finishes
 * `succeeded` with deliveryOutcome='awaiting_external_merge' — the factory is
 * deliberately blocked from merging, so a human merges (or closes) the MR/PR in
 * the SCM. Nothing else notices that. This poller closes the loop: each tick it
 * asks the registry which runs are still awaiting an external merge, reads the
 * live change-request state from the SCM, and when it has moved:
 *
 *   merged → emit change_request:merged (the registry stamps the run row to
 *            'merged' and records a "merged externally" notification), then move
 *            the ticket to Done — the same tail as the internal /api/scm/merge.
 *   closed → emit change_request:closed (run row → 'closed', notification); the
 *            ticket is left where it is (a human rejected the work, on purpose).
 *
 * A run leaves the watch set once merged. A closed one is re-checked for a day
 * and corrected to merged if the SCM says so (see runsAwaitingExternalMerge). Best-effort per run: one unreachable
 * repo or transient SCM error is logged and retried next tick, never stalling
 * the batch. Lives in the api because it needs the SCM + ticket providers and
 * the org config, exactly like the work-queue scheduler.
